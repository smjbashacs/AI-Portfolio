This project deals with using ML algorithms to classify data points. We will be using Decision trees, Linear Regression, and Random forests.
Deep learning algorithms. And also here I want to explore different projects related to MLP, text generation and Generative AI models, which are quite crucial for current world. I will like to share all these projects on open source.
